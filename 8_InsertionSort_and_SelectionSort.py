# Implementation of Insertion sort and selection sort

"""# INSERTION SORT
# Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.
# It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.

# Worst complexity: n^2
# Average complexity: n^2
# Best complexity: n
# Space complexity: 1


# SELECTION SORT
# In computer science, selection sort is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm.
# It has an O(nÂ²) time complexity, which makes it inefficient on large lists,
# and generally performs worse than the similar insertion sort.

# Worst complexity: n^2
# Average complexity: n^2
# Best complexity: n^2
# Space complexity: 1"""
